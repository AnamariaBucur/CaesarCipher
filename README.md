# Caesar Cipher in Java 🔐

This project implements the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
This project supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, and keeps non-letter characters (spaces, digits, punctuation) unchanged.
